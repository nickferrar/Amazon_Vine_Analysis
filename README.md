# Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to examine reviews of Amazon's paid and unpaid vine program. The findings of this analysis will provide insight into whether there is a positivity
bias in the paid and unpaid versions of the program. The data set that was analyzed was for video game products. 

# Results:

In this data set:
* There were 94 total paid vine reviews and 40471 unpaid vine reviews. 
* There were 48 5 star paid reviews and 15663 5 star unpaid reviews.
* The percentage of 5 star paid reviews is 51.06% and the percentage of unpaid 5 star reviews is 38.7%

# Summary:

There's about 13% more 5 star reviews is the paid program than the unpaid program. While at first this would suggest a positivity bias, I think more analysis would be needed as it 
is possible that the higher profile games are being reviewed in the paid program rather than the unpaid program. Also the sample size for the paid review program is fairly low 
and should be taken into consideration.
